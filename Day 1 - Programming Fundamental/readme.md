# Day 1 - Programming Fundamental

### Programming Fundamentals
Thought process to solve a problem
- Understand the problem 
- Check inputs in problem
- Final approach

#### Flowchart
Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often it use as a program planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing. The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “Flowchart”

#### Component of flowchart

#### Pseudocode
Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language. Pseudocode is sometimes used as a detailed step in the process of developing a program.
#### Ex
1.	Write a pseudocode for difference of two number
```
Step 1: start
Step 2: declear a, b and diff
Step 3: read a and b
Step 4: diff = a – b
Step 5: end
```

2.	Write pseudocode to print average of 2 values
```
Step 1: start
Step 2: declear a, b and avg
Step 3: read a and b
Step 4: avg = a + b / 2
Step 5: end
```

### Problem statement on above two topics
#### Ex
1.	Add 2 number by taking input
#### Flowchart

#### Pseudocode
```
Step 1: start
Step 2: declear a, b, sum
Step 3: sum = a + b
Step 4: print sum
Step5: end
```

2.	Find circumference of a circle
#### Flowchart

#### Pseudocode
```
Step 1: start
Step 2: declear r, cir
Step 3: cir = 2 * 3.14 * r
Step 4: print cir 
Step 5: end
```

3.	Check number is even or odd
#### Flowchart

#### Pseudocode
```
Step 1: start
Step 2: declear n
Step 3: if n % 2 = 0 then print even
	  Else print odd
Step 4: end
```

4.	Student and grade flowchart 
#### Flowchart

#### Pseudocode
```
Step 1: start
Step 2: read n
Step 3: if n >= 90 then print A
    	  Else if n >= 80 then print B
	  Else if n >= 60 then print C
	Else if n >= 40 then print D
	Else print F
Step 4: end
```
