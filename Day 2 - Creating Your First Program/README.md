# Day 2 - Creating Your First Program

### Programming Languages
#### Why we need it?
- A Language using which, we can instruct the computer to carry out real life tasks and computations is called a programming language. It acts as a language in which we could easily express our thoughts to the machine.
- Like natural languages, programming language has a fixed set of rules according to which programs could be written in it. These programs are then converted into a language which machines can understand. This task is carried out by a special software called compiler
- Every angquage has its own compiler/Interpreter.
- Once a program is compiled and linked, its executable is created and the computer can run our program now.

### IDE
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.

### Datatypes & Variables
A variable in C is a memory location associated with some name in order to store some form of data and retrieve it when required & data types are used to tell the variables the type of data they can store.
